# Slack Invitation app

When you administer a free Slack group, you might know this issue: copying and pasting emails to invite new members is quite cumbersome. It would be so much easier, if they could just fill in their email into a form, hit the submit button and receive an invite from Slack automatically... BINGO! That's exactly what this little Ruby / Sinatra app is doing :-)

_Let people invite themselves to your Slack group with this very simple Ruby / Sinatra app_

## Setup

If you want to use this app for your own Slack group, you just have to change the contents of `Config.rb` to match your information.

## Development


## Testing
